# Etch-a-sketch

This Etch-a-Sketch app allows users to draw on a virtual canvas by hovering over grid cells. Users can choose between three drawing modes: black, rainbow (random colors), and eraser (white). The grid size can be customized, and the current grid size is displayed dynamically. The app provides a reset button to clear the canvas.
